## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Goal

Create a **voice-driven, multi-interaction audiobook experience** where: (a) the app reads books aloud, (b) children can ask natural-language questions by voice and receive answers grounded in the book, and (c) the app proactively asks simple, age-appropriate questions to encourage comprehension and engagement.

### 1.2 Product Concept

- Core loop: **Listen → Ask/Answer → Continue**.
- Voice interface covers playback control (play/pause/skip), in-story Q&A, and comprehension checks.
- Ground answers in **book content** first; supplement with safe, curated external knowledge for common “why/how” questions when appropriate.


### 1.3 Target Users

- **Primary interactor:** Children ages **0–7**.
- **Account owner & buyer:** Parent/guardian.
- **Secondary:** Educators and caregivers.

### 1.4 Competitor Landscape (high-level)

- **Millie’s Library (KR):** AI voice audiobooks; no widely available two-way child voice interaction reported.
- **Welaa (KR):** Professional narrator audiobooks; no widely available two-way child voice interaction reported.
- **Differentiator:** Our focus on **real-time, child-safe, two-way voice Q&A** and comprehension prompts tied to each book.

## 12. Risks & Mitigations

- **R1: Latency too high for child patience.** → Optimize streaming ASR/TTS; cache targeted passages; prefetch likely QA.
- **R2: Hallucination/unsafe answers.** → Strict grounding to in-book content; rule-based fallbacks; parental filters; safety moderation.
- **R3: Licensing constraints.** → Start with public-domain or partner sample titles; negotiate rights early.
- **R4: Speech recognition for young voices.** → Fine-tune with child speech datasets; fallback to touch choices.
- **R5: Privacy/COPPA non-compliance.** → Build consent flow early; data minimization and deletion workflows.
